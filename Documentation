Environment setup: 
  Update the list of available packages in the environment
    $sudo apt-get update 
	Installs the newer versions of the packages we already have installed

  Edit /lib/systemd/system/bluetooth.service
      add '-C' after the word 'bluetoothd' and result will look like "bluetoothd -C" 
   Load serial port
      $sudo sdptool add SP
   Reboot the raspberry pi
      sudo reboot
   Command to run after each reboot
      To make your pi bluetooth Discoverable
        $sudo hciconfig hci0 piscan
      change your device name to 'Device Name' $Todo. Change this to panion
        $sudo hciconfig hci0 name 'Device Name' 
  
Text editor and file access
    Samba:
      $sudo apt-get install samba samba-common-bin

Auto bluetooth pairing ( files are in autoparing folder in git"
	1) Create a file called  "/usr/local/bin/auto-agent" containing the following code.
	2) Make file executable
		$sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/auto-agent
	3) Create a file called "/usr/local/bin/bluezutils.py" containing the following code
	4) Create a file called "BtAutoPair.py" (you can save this anywhere convenient) containing the following code.
	5) Create a file called "testAutoPair.py (save this in the same directory as BtAutoPair.py) containing the following code.
	
	To check if it's working just run testAutoPair.py. You should then be able to pair your Pi to your phone without entering anything on the Pi.If you are using legacy pairing then the code to enter on the phone is "0000".
	You will need to install python-pexpect if it's not already installed.
		$sudo apt install python-pexpect
	You will need to install python-dbus if it's not already installed.
		$sudo apt install python-dbus
	To make the Pi permanently discoverable edit "/etc/bluetooth/main.conf" and change the line :
		#DiscoverableTimeout = 0
		To :
		DiscoverableTimeout = 0
